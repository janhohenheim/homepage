                    In 2017, I got pretty engaged in the Rust online community. I've created open source libraries,
                    contributed to big Rust projects and wrote a ton of
                    answers on StackOverflow. Sooner or later, Packt Publishing noticed me and asked me to write a book
                    about
                    Rust for them, aimed at intermediate developers that want to use the standard library as effectively
                    as
                    possible.
                    Deciding that free time is overrated anyways, I accepted their offer. Not gonna lie, the next half a
                    year
                    was pretty damn tough. But I managed to do it, and I'm proud of the result! You can read the whole
                    marketing shebang

                    Me and some friends created an algorithm which combines the genetic algorithm proposed by Dr.
                    Stanley's
                    NEAT
                    (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)
                    with modern convolutional neural networks using residual networks.
                    Alright, sorry about that, for the three people that haven't stopped reading yet: We think that
                    modern
                    artificial neural networks built for visual recognition are too rigid. So, we used a technique for
                    developing
                    a neural network dynamically, based on real life evolution, and modified it to generate visual
                    pattern
                    matching networks. As a bonus, the paper also contains some sections explaining the tools used and
                    the
                    most
                    important buzzwords and concepts of neural networks in general.

                        For you non-Swiss people out there: The Messerli Informatik AG is the leading software provider
                        for
                        small and really big
                        construction projects in Switzerland. Doesn't mean that I know anything about construction, hell
                        no.
                        I was entrusted with the underlying base libraries that power the ongoing rewrite of the
                        company's
                        software.
                        Server communication, update rollouts, licensing logic, functional programming utilities,
                        code guidelines, that kind of stuff.
                        But before that, my job consisted of working with, or rather around, our horribly outdated
                        codebase.
                        Out of
                        frustration with
                        the code quality,
                        I tended to use my time not to just put a makeshift patch on an obvious problem, but to actually
                        redesign the
                        faulty abstraction in a durable way. This attitude also grew into an interest in optimizing the
                        work ethic and team organizations of the company. After talking about it with the company's
                        executive manager (i.e. the big boss), I took a certification course as a Scrum Master and
                        drastically reorganized
                        the pilot team for our new structures.

                        When the big rewrite of the Messerli legacy software started, I was chosen as the lead for the

                        formed team up for the task.
                        We were quite the perfectionist bunch. We took our time, but when we delivered, we
                        delivered <span class="emphasis-text">good</span>.
                        Our dynamic was focused on profiting from each other as much as possible: Every pull request
                        went
                        through rigorous code reviews,
                        new co-workers were made to read Clean Code and our in-depth coding guidelines, all decisions I
                        had
                        to make for the team were
                        bounced
                        around everyone's head first. I cherish the time I had with my team, it was an honor working
                        along
                        such talented and genuinly passionate people.

                        I spent my last year at the Messerli Informatik AG as a project lead. During this time, I had to
                        learn
                        just how much coordination and politics are necessary to get stuff done on a project spanning
                        multiple teams. I kept my administrative roles from before my promotion, but had to reduce my
                        code
                        output
                        by a lot in order to meet the demands of my new position.
                        This was by far the most bureaucratic time of my career: protocols, agendas, meetings,
                        evaluations,
                        lots of paper. And way too much coffee.

                        During our time writing the paper mentioned before, my friends and I came up with some novel
                        ideas
                        about how to
                        evolve a more general AI than the state of the art pattern recognition machines. We pooled
                        together
                        some money in order
                        to explore those ideas for a year. I credit this time with teaching me about project management:
                        How
                        to organize work, how
                        to be productive with no externel pressure, how to realistically plan work. I also learned how
                        to
                        plan and structure
                        the code base of big projects involving multiple people, creating a lasting flaire for

                        With my programmer's education, I was not instantly allowed to study biomedicine. I lacked 3

                        of general, non-IT knowledge.
                        In order to be admitted to a university, I had to either study for 3 additional years or catch
                        up on
                        them in a single year in my free time.
                        The latter way is called Passerelle, and it was right up my alley. This year was intense, but in

                        Today, I am studying biomedicine, which is a specialized biology degree focussing on the human
                        body.
